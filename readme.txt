This plugin allows you to compress and optimize your WordPress images through the CheetahO API. Your website will be faster, keeping the images high quality.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to resize/scale images down to your specified size, optimize and compress new and existing WordPress image uploads through CheetahO Image [optimizer](https://cheetaho.com/?utm_source=wordpress-plugin&utm_medium=readme) API. You can choose lossless or lossy optimization modes. At this moment supported filetypes are JPEG, PNG, GIF.
Smaller image sizes on your website mean faster page loads and less bandwidth usage. The faster your site loads, the more Google, Yahoo, Bing, and other search engines will like it.
You can try a **quick demo** <a href="https://wpsandbox.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.
Also you can create a staging copy of your site using <a href="https://wp-staging.com/" target="_blank">WP Staging</a> and test it there.

Set a max width and height and large images will scale down as they are being compressed. CheetahO compresses images using a proprietary algorithm & blazing fast servers to quickly compress images & optimize images. Also cuts all the unnecessary data without slowing down your website/blog which helps to boost SEO & performance.

= About the plugin =
* You can use your CheetahO API key on as many sites/blogs as you like. We have no per-site license.
* All images uploaded throught the media uploader are optimized on-the-fly. All generated thumbnails are optimized too.
* All images already present in the media library can be optimized individually, or using the Bulk Action.
* All optimization is carried out by sending images to CheetahO and pulling the optimized files to your WordPress installation.
* All full size images can be resized/rescaled before optimization by setting maximum width and height.
* To use this plugin, you must obtain a full API key from CheetahO [panel](https://app.cheetaho.com/api-credentials?utm_source=wordpress-plugin&utm_medium=readme).

Once you have obtained your credentials, from your WordPress admin, go to the settings page and there you can enter your API credentials, and select your optimization preferences. Once you have done this, click on **Save**. If everything is in order, it will simply say "settings saved" and give you a reassuring green tick that your credentials are valid. You can now start optimizing images from within Media Library. Any image you upload from now on, through any of the media upload screens will be optimized on-the-fly.
